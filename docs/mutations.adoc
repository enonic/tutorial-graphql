In this section, we will look at how to add a `Mutation` to our GraphQL schema.
In GraphQL, mutations are used to modify data on the server.

Let’s say we need a Notes API to manage notes.
This API should allow users to add new notes, view individual notes, delete notes, and retrieve a list of all notes.

== Defining the Note type

First, we need to define a `Note` type that describes the structure of a note object.
Here's a basic example:

.src/main/resources/apis/graphql/schema.js
[source,js]
----
const noteType = schemaGenerator.createObjectType({
    name: 'Note',
    fields: {
        id: {
            type: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.GraphQLID),
        },
        title: {
            type: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.GraphQLString),
        },
        content: {
            type: graphQlLib.GraphQLString,
        },
        createdAt: {
            type: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.String),
        }
    }
});
----

In this example, we define the fields for a GraphQL Object Type using the `schemaGenerator.createObjectType` function and apply constraints such as not-null to ensure required fields are properly validated.

== Defining the root Mutation type

Defining a mutation works the same way as defining any other GraphQL Object Type.
The only difference is that the mutation type must be assigned to the `mutation` field when building the schema.

Let's define the root `Mutation` type to specify which operations can modify the data.
For the Notes API, we will include mutations for creating and deleting notes:

.src/main/resources/apis/graphql/schema.js
[source,js]
----
const rootMutationType = schemaGenerator.createObjectType({
    name: 'Mutation',
    fields: {
        createNote: {
            type: graphQlLib.reference('Note'),
            args: {
                title: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.GraphQLString),
                content: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.GraphQLString),
            },
            resolve: (env) => {
                // Creates the note and returns it as the result.
            }
        },
        deleteNote: {
            type: graphQlLib.reference('Note'),
            args: {
                id: graphQlLib.nonNull(graphQlLib.GraphQLID),
            },
            resolve: (env) => {
                // Removes the note and returns it as the result.
            }
        },
    }
});
----

This example is slightly more complex than defining the `Note` type.
Here, we use arguments for the `createNote` and `deleteNote` fields, and we also define `resolve` functions for them.
In general, if a field name matches the corresponding property in the source object and the value should be returned as-is, the `resolve` function can be omitted.

Also, notice how we reference the `Note` object in these fields.
To specify the field type, we use the `graphQlLib.reference` function.

NOTE: You could also directly use the `noteType` variable, which was initialized when creating the `Note` type. However, using `graphQlLib.reference` is preferred, especially for larger schemas.

Now, let’s see how the `rootMutationType` is used when creating the schema:

.src/main/resources/apis/graphql/schema.js
[source,js]
----
const graphQLSchema = schemaGenerator.createSchema({
    query: rootQueryType, // <1>
    mutation: rootMutationType, // <2>
    dictionary: [noteType] // <3>
});
----

<1> Sets the root `Query` type to handle data fetching operations.
<2> Sets the root `Mutation` type to handle data modification operations.
<3> Lists the types used in the schema, including custom objects like `Note`.

NOTE: `dictionary` is also necessary to ensure that objects referenced via `reference` are properly resolved and included in the schema.


Here is the complete example implementation of schema.js. You can also see the implementation of the `getNote` and `getNotes` fields for the root `Query` type, which we omitted earlier since their implementation follows the same approach as the fields described in this section.

./src/main/resources/apis/graphql/schema.js
[source,js]
----
include::{sourcedir}/samples/mutation-schema.js[]
----

NOTE: For simplicity, we use a plain JavaScript object as our data store.

The image below shows the result of a `createNote` mutation executed in the GraphiQL UI.
